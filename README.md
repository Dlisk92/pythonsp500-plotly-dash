## Getting set up

1. Clone this repository:  ``git clone https://github.com/kdboller/pythonsp500-plotly-dash``; or 
2. Hit 'Clone or download' on the main repo page in order to grab the Jupyter notebook and the sample excel file; or
3. The notebook itself can be downloaded on nbviewer; link is [to come]().

Note:  For best results in running the Python script, it is recommended that you have Python 3.6 or greater.  There is also a requirements.txt file included in this repo.

I also recommend setting up a virtual environment.  I manage all of my virtual environments with Anaconda.  Here [to come] is an explanation on how to set up virtual environments within Anaconda.

## Note on Anaconda distribution

I highly recommend that you download the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  You can also run the notebook without Anaconda using ``pip`` to install the required packages, however Anaconda is the industry standard for data science.

For any packages not distributed under Anaconda, e.g., the Yahoo Finance package fix, you can do the following directly in a cell within the notebook:
``!pip install [name of package]``
